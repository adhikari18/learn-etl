4. Getting familiarization with these tools and technologies will be very helpful
	- Programming Skills: Learn a programming language commonly used in ETL development, such as Python or Java. 
	These languages enable you to write custom scripts, perform complex transformations, and automate ETL workflows. 
	- Version Control: Version control tools like GIT facilitates collaboration and maintains data integrity.
